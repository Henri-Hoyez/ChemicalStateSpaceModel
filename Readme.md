# Domain Shift Simulator:
This repository is storing the dataset released in the paper *"Which Time Series Domain Shifts can Neural Networks Adapt to?"*

The goal of this dataset is to generate several domain shifts using State Space Models (SSM). These domain shift and their further explanation are listed in the paper.

# Description:

To generate the dataset, be sure that all libraries are installed:
- Numpy;
- Pandas;
- Tables;
- Matplotlib;


# Generate datasets:
---
To generate the domain shift dataset, execute the following command line:

``
./generate_domains.sh
``
